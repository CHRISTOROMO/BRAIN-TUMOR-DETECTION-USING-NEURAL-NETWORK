# BRAIN TUMOUR DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION

## Description
The main objective of this project was to develop a convolutional neural network that could accurately detect the presence of a tumor from an MRI scan. Furthermore, after detection, the model was to classify the tumor as either a glioma, meningioma, or pituitary tumor.

## Streamlit Deployment

The designed model attained a high prediction accuracy of 97%. It was later deployed on streamlit as a [web application](https://share.streamlit.io/deborahmasibo/moringa-core-module-2-project/main/bt2/braintumour2.py).
