# BRAIN TUMOUR DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION

## Descritption
The main objective of this project was to develop a convolutional neural network that could accurately detect the presence of a tumour from an MRI scan. Fruthermore, after detecion, the model was to classify the tumour as either a glioma, meningioma or pituitary tumour. 

## Streamlit Deployment

The designed model attained a high predictio accuracy of 97%. It was later deployed on streamlit as a web application.
